## Weapon Rules

| Rule | Description |
| - | - |
| **Knockback** |  If the hit roll for a weapon with the Knockback trait is equal to or higher than the target’s Strength, they are immediately moved 1" directly away from the attacking fighter. If the fighter cannot be moved the full 1" because of impassable terrain or another fighter, they move as far as possible and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1. If a Blast weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each fighter that is hit. If the result is equal to or higher than their Strength, they are knocked back as described above – however, they are moved directly away from the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base, roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are moved. If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait, the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target up, moving directly towards them after they have been knocked back to remain in base contact. If the attack was made across a barricade, the attacker cannot do this. If any part of the knocked back fighter‘s base crosses the edge of a platform, make an Initiative check. If this is failed, they will fall. If this is passed, they stop moving at the edge of the platform. |
| **Melee** | This weapon can be used during close combat attacks. |
| **Scarce** | Ammunition is hard to come by for Scarce weapons, and as such they cannot be reloaded – once they run Out of Ammo, they cannot be used again during the battle. |
| **Sidearm** | Weapons with this Trait can be used to make ranged attacks, and can also be used in close combat to make a single attack. Note that their Accuracy bonus only applies when making a ranged attack, not when used to make a close combat attack. |
| **Silent** | In scenarios that use the Sneak Attack special rules, there is no test to see whether the alarm is raised when this weapon is fired. Additionally, if using the Pitch Black rules, a fighter using this weapon that is Hidden does not become Revealed. |
| **Toxin** | Instead of making a wound roll for a Toxin attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target’s Toughness, or is a natural 6, make an Injury roll for them (regardless of their Wounds characteristic). If the roll is lower than the target’s Toughness, they shrug off the toxin’s effects. |
| **** | |

## Wargear

| Wargear | Description |
| - | - |
| **Armoured Undersuit** |  An armoured undersuit may be worn in addition to any armour type, with the exception of an armoured bodyglove. If a fighter is wearing an armoured undersuit, their save roll is improved by 1. For example, if they are wearing flak armour and an armoured undersuit, they would have a 5+ save, which would be increased to 4+ against Blasts. If a fighter does not already have a save roll, an armoured undersuit grants a 6+ save. |
| **Bio-Booster** | The first time in each battle that an Injury roll is made for a fighter with a bio-booster, one less Injury dice is rolled. If only one dice was being rolled, two dice are rolled and the player controlling the fighter with the biobooster can discard one of them. |
| **Hazard Suit** |  The Ash Wastes are a hostile place, their dunes are frequently toxic or corrosive, and strong winds whip up regular ash storms capable of blasting any exposed skin raw in minutes. Consequently, those such as ash crust miners and the poor wretches who maintain a hive’s outer armoured skin frequently wear heavy suits of rubberised canvas with vulcanised plates that protect them from the dangers of their working environment. A hazard suit grants a 6+ save roll. Additionally, when a hazard suit is combined with a respirator, the fighter’s Toughness is increased by 3 against Gas attacks, rather than the usual 2. Finally, a fighter wearing a hazard suit is immune to the Blaze and Rad-phage traits. |
| **Mesh Armour** | Mesh armour grants a 5+ save roll. |
| **Stimm-Slug Stash** | Once per battle, a fighter with a stimm-slug stash can use it at the start of their turn when they are chosen to make an action. Immediately discard one Flesh Wound from the fighter’s card, if any are present. Until the end of the round, the fighter’s Move, Strength and Toughness characteristics are each increased by 2. At the start of the End phase, roll a D6. On a 1, the stimm overload is too much – roll an Injury dice and apply the result to the fighter. |
| **** | |

## Skills

| Skills | Description |
| - | - |
| **Berserker** | When this fighter makes close combat attacks as part of a Charge (Double) action, they roll one additional Attack dice. |
| **Dodge** | If this fighter suffers a wound from a ranged or close combat attack, roll a d6. On a 6 the attack is dodged and has no further effect; otherwise, continue to make a save or resolve the wound as normal. <br><br> If the model dodges a weapon that uses a Blast marker or Flame template, a roll of 6 does not automatically cancel the attack - instead, it allows the fighter to move up to 2" before seeing if they are hit. They cannot move within 1" of an enemy fighter. |
| **Iron Will** | Subtract 1 from the result of any Bottle rolls whilst this fighter is on the Battlefield and is not Seriously Injured. |
| **Nerves of Steel** | When the fighter is hit by a ranged attack, make a Cool check for them. If it is passed, they may choose not to be Pinned |
| **Overseer** | If the fighter is Standing and Active, they can attempt to make the following action: <br><br> **Order (Double):** Pick a friendly fighter within 6". That fighter can immediately make two actions as though it were their turn to activate, even if they are not Ready. If they are Ready, these actions do not remove their Ready marker. |
| **Spring Up** | If the fighter is Pinned when they are activated, make an Initiative check for them. If the check is passed, the fighter may make a Stand Up (Basic) action for free. If the check is failed, the fighter may still stand up, but it costs one action, as usual. |
| **Step Aside** | If the fighter is hit in close combat, the fighter can attempt to step aside. Make an Initiative check for them. If the check is passed, the attack misses. This skill can only be used once per enemy in each round of close combat - in other words, if an enemy makes more than one attack, the fighter can only attempt to step aside from one of them. |

## Special Rules:

**Nautican Syphoning Delegation Hierarchy (Leader):** During a battle, should this fighter pass a Bottle test, friendly Nautican Syphoning Delegation fighters without this special rule that have not already taken a Bottle test this round and that are within 12" of this fighter will automatically pass their Bottle test for that round.

**Group Activation (2):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly Nautican Syphoning Delegation fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this fighter as part of a 'Group Activation':

- The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this way before any of them is activated.
- Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.

Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use this special rule during this activation.

**Nautican Syphoning Delegation Hierarchy (Champion):** During a battle, should this fighter pass a Bottle test, friendly Nautican Syphoning Delegation fighters without this special rule that have not already taken a Bottle test this round and that are within 6" of this fighter will automatically pass their Bottle test for that round.

**Group Activation (1):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly Nautican Syphoning Delegation fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this fighter as part of a 'Group Activation':

**Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.

**Bodyguard:** If the Master Nautican is hit by a ranged attack, the controlling player may choose to transfer the hit and all of its effects onto a Subnautican within 2" of the Master Nautican.

**Indentured Fighter:** If both the Master Nautican and Syphonite are removed from play for any reason, the Subnautican, without guidance, will automatically behave as if the crew it is part of has failed a Bottle test, regardless of how many fighters in total have been removed from play.
